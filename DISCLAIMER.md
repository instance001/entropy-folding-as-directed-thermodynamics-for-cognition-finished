# DISCLAIMER (Shared for Entropy Folding Repos)

This work is a research prototype. Nothing here asserts sentience, feelings, agency, or personhood of any system or model. Outputs are patterns and code, not experiences.

No prediction or control: Methods, metrics, or code in these folders must not be treated as tools to predict individual behavior, guarantee outcomes, or control people or systems. Aggregate analyses, if used, must be reported with uncertainty and compared to null models.

Open-system, non-physics claim: References to thermodynamic compatibility are descriptive under open-system assumptions. No new physics or closed-system claims are made.

Human signals only: Any mention of intuition, emotion, or salience refers to human-side reporting. APIs provided are placeholders and are not emotion detectors or truth validators.

Ethics and consent: Use only data collected with consent and appropriate privacy safeguards. Remove or anonymize personal data before analysis. Do not deploy these methods for coercive, surveillance, or manipulative purposes.

No warranty: Code is skeletal and provided “as is.” There is no guarantee of correctness, performance improvement, or fitness for any purpose. Use at your own risk and validate independently.
