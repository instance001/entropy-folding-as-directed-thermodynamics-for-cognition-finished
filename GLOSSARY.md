| Term | Alternate term(s) | Alt map | External map | Relation to existing terminology | What it is | What it is not | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entropy Folding | folding cycle | ~ | ~ | Proposed capacity-raising process | Cycle: vault unresolved items (`E_v`), fold/reorganize (`F`), estimate capacity (`M/ΔM`) via proxies, observe insights (`I`), log projects (`P`); positioned as thermodynamically compatible in open systems | Not a claim of new physics; not guaranteed performance gain | entropy-folding-as-directed-thermodynamics-for-cognition-finished/paper.md |
| Vaulted entropy (`E_v`) | vault | ~ | ~ | Unresolved task pool | Logged unresolved tasks with constraints/failed attempts | Not energy measure; not discarded tasks | entropy-folding-as-directed-thermodynamics-for-cognition-finished/paper.md |
| Folding (`F`) | reorganization step | ~ | ~ | Operational action | Countable reorganizations (clustering, constraint rewrites, ordering changes) applied to vaulted items | Not solving the tasks directly; not hidden inference | entropy-folding-as-directed-thermodynamics-for-cognition-finished/paper.md |
| Capacity proxy (`M/ΔM`) | ΔM proxies | ~ | ~ | Measurement proxies | Time-to-solve, error rate, plan compression, backtracking reduction, transfer performance tracked pre/post fold | Not ground-truth capacity; proxy only | entropy-folding-as-directed-thermodynamics-for-cognition-finished/README.md |
| Insight (`I`) | performance burst | ~ | ~ | Outcome marker | Discrete performance jump following folding | Not guaranteed after every fold; not free of cost | entropy-folding-as-directed-thermodynamics-for-cognition-finished/paper.md |
| Projects (`P`) | P | = | ∅ | Internal outcome/artifact variable | Concrete outputs created post-insight; counted and timestamped; feed the next vaulted entropy (`E_v`) | Not a claim that outputs validate the theory; not a guarantee of value | entropy-folding-as-directed-thermodynamics-for-cognition-finished/paper.md |
| Comparison null models | null models | ~ | = | Standard null-model baselining | Three baselines used to bound claims about folding effects (Poisson bursts, random-walk skill change, cumulative practice) | Not evidence by itself; not a substitute for measurement/controls | entropy-folding-as-directed-thermodynamics-for-cognition-finished/paper.md |
